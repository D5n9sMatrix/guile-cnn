# 1.8 Typographical Conventions

In examples and procedure descriptions and all other 
places where the evaluation of Scheme expression is 
shown, we use some notation for denoting the output 
and evaluation results of expressions.

The symbol ‘⇒’ is used to tell which value is returned 
by an evaluation: 

COMMAND LINE TERMINATE BASH:

```
guile
```

DIGIT ...

```
(+ 1 2)
```

PREVIEW ...

```
GNU Guile 2.2.7
Copyright (C) 1995-2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Guile comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `,show w'.
This program is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `,show c' for details.

Enter `,help' for help.
scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 1 2)
$1 = 3
```

Some procedures produce some output besides 
returning a value. This is denoted by the 
symbol ‘-|’.

DIGIT ...

```
(begin (display 1) (newline) 'hooray)
-| 1
- hooray
```

PREVIEW

```
scheme@(guile-user) [26]> (begin (display 1) (newline) 'hooray)
1
$7 = hooray
```

As you can see, this code prints ‘1’ (denoted by ‘-|’), and returns 
hooray (denoted by ‘⇒’). 


# 2.1 Running Guile Interactively

In its simplest form, Guile acts as an interactive interpreter 
for the Scheme programming language, reading and evaluating Scheme 
expressions the user enters from the terminal. Here is a sample 
interaction between Guile and a user; the user’s input appears 
after the $ and scheme@(guile-user)> prompts:

DIGIT ...
```
$ guile
scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 1 2 3)                ; add some numbers
$1 = 6
scheme@(guile-user)> (define (factorial n)    ; define a function
(if (zero? n) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
scheme@(guile-user)> (factorial 20)
$2 = 2432902008176640000
scheme@(guile-user)> (getpwnam "root")        ; look in /etc/passwd
$3 = #("root" "x" 0 0 "root" "/root" "/bin/bash")
scheme@(guile-user)> C-d
$
```


# 2.2 Running Guile Scripts

Like AWK, Perl, or any shell, Guile can interpret script files. 
A Guile script is simply a file of Scheme code with some extra information 
at the beginning which tells the operating system how to invoke Guile, and 
then tells Guile how to handle the Scheme code.

Here is a trivial Guile script. See Guile Scripting, for more details.

DIGIT ...
```
#!/usr/local/bin/guile -s
!#
(display "Hello, world!")
(newline)
```

# 2.5.1 Using Modules

Guile comes with a lot of useful modules, for example for string processing or 
command line parsing. Additionally, there exist many Guile modules written by 
other Guile hackers, but which have to be installed manually.

Here is a sample interactive session that shows how to use the (ice-9 popen) 
module which provides the means for communicating with other processes over 
pipes together with the (ice-9 rdelim) module that provides the function 
read-line.

```
$ guile
scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (ice-9 popen))
scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (ice-9 rdelim))
scheme@(guile-user)> (define p (open-input-pipe "ls -l"))
scheme@(guile-user)> (read-line p)
$1 = "total 30"
scheme@(guile-user)> (read-line p)
$2 = "drwxr-sr-x    2 mgrabmue mgrabmue     1024 Mar 29 19:57 CVS"
```

# 2.5.2 Writing new Modules

You can create new modules using the syntactic form define-module. 
All definitions following this form until the next define-module 
are placed into the new module.

One module is usually placed into one file, and that file is installed 
in a location where Guile can automatically find it. The following session 
shows a simple example.

```
$ cat /usr/local/share/guile/site/foo/bar.scm

(define-module (foo bar)
  #:export (frob))

(define (frob x) (* 2 x))

$ guile
scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (foo bar))
scheme@(guile-user)> (frob 12)
$1 = 24
```

# 3.1.3 Defining and Setting Variables

To define a new variable, you use Scheme’s define 
syntax like this:

```
(define variable-name value)
```

This makes a new variable called variable-name 
and stores value in it as the variable’s initial 
value. For example:

```
;; Make a variable `x' with initial numeric value 1.
(define x 1)

;; Make a variable `organization' with an initial string value.
(define organization "Free Software Foundation")
```

(In Scheme, a semicolon marks the beginning of a comment that 
continues until the end of the line. So the lines beginning ;; 
are comments.)

Changing the value of an already existing variable is very 
similar, except that define is replaced by the Scheme syntax 
set!, like this:

```
(set! variable-name new-value)
```

# 3.2.2 Simple Procedure Invocation

In this expression, procedure can be any Scheme expression 
whose value is a procedure. Most commonly, however, procedure 
is simply the name of a variable whose value is a procedure.

For example, string-append is a standard Scheme procedure 
whose behaviour is to concatenate together all the arguments, 
which are expected to be strings, that it is given. So the 
expression

```
(string-append "/home" "/" "admin")
```


is a procedure invocation whose result is the numeric value 3.

Each of the parameters in a procedure invocation can itself be 
any Scheme expression. Since a procedure invocation is itself 
a type of expression, we can put these two examples together 
to get

```
(string-length (string-append "/home" "/" "admin"
```

# 3.3.1.2 Evaluating a Variable Reference

When an expression that consists simply of a variable 
name is evaluated, the value of the expression is the 
value of the named variable. The evaluation of a variable 
reference expression has no side effects.

So, after

```
(define key "admin")
```


the value of the expression key is the string value 
"Paul Evans". If key is then modified by 

```
(set! key 3.27)
```
